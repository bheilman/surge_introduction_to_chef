Hello,

It's time for Surge!  I must admit, this is one of my favorite conferences of the year.  

Thank you for signing up for the [Introduction to Chef tutorial](http://surge.omniti.com/2014/speakers/speakers.html?harvey-nathen) on Wednesday.  I'll be leading that tutorial and we're going to have a lot of fun and learn a thing or two along the way.

We're going to try out some new material and introduce you to Chef and to testing your automation code.  There will be lots of hands-on time and we need to be sure everyone comes prepared and ready to dive right in.
